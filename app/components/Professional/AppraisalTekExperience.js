        <P>
          We are a small Appraisal Management Company (AMC) driven by unequaled
          customer service. We all ware many hats and work close together
          following the “selfless service” model. A team to be proud of! I have
          the pleaser to be leading multiple development teams through the scrum
          process. Working and problem solving alongside great minds.

            <h5>Facilitator of communication</h5>
            The best work gets done when done when both sides are talking with
            each other. I see this as one of the greatest aspects of success and
            my primary role.

            <h5>Development Leader / Scrum master / Product Owner</h5>
            Provide the direction and organization for multiple teams, driving
            focus and clarity. Reduced the working project count, down to an
            list of business needs. This focus gave certainty and fewer fewer
            fewer distractions. Creating a paradigm shift from “working numerous
            projects at once” to “pushing small projects to completion”.
            Reducing from 95% sprint carry over, to 10% sprint carry over.
            Keeping an 80/20 balance of business projects and Tech debt within a
            sprint.
