        When you crack open this project you might be surprised with whats going on. It started off as a fun exploratory project to test the latest technology. It has been striped and repurposed to what you see now, The Portfolio.

        This Project was originally set out for the making of a large scalable website. Using technologys like Redux, Redux-Sagas, Jest and many more things. You can see the structure of what this looked like in the

        <ul>
          <li>
            Start making something - In the interview process I noticed some questions repeating, so why not answer them here.
          </li>
          <li>
            Ignore the details early on - I needed content not to focus on the setup of a website. This project had it all already just no content.

          <li>
            Good enough is fine - Software development is an iterative process and will continue to change. Why wait for perfection?
          </li>
          <li>
            Quick wins - In the end using this project I was able to get my message out and do it fast. That is my win.
